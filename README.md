## 1 - Introduction

A client Pillo Corp. wants to create a model that will help them successfully predict the sale price of a house for their website. They're juding the success of a model based on the RMSE of the log(target) and log(predictions) of the model. They want this number to be 0.13897 or lower to be considered a success.
